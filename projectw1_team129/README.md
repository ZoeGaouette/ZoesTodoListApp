# Personal Project
:arrow_forward: Please refer to [edX][1] for description and instructions.
September 14:
-I started from scratch and created my code for my to-do list application.
-I created two classes: MainScreen and Task
-I found that whenever I tried to produce the to-do list in a sout, I would only get the hashcode for the item in the array, not the details of the item.
To resolve this I found some code on stackOverflow, that allowed me to use override and the toString() method to produce the items in the array for the user.
-I tried to create a method that allowed the user to search for tasks, but I got stuck when it wouldn't let me call a method from a non-static context into a static context



September 16:
-I was able to fix my code so that I could produce the details of the items in the arraylist, without having to use that code with @Override.
-I added getters and setters to my Task class.
-I added an infinite while loop so that the user can add tasks infinitely, until they choose to return to the main menu.
-I added the ability for the user to exit the application from the main menu.


September 29th:
-saved myself from certain death
